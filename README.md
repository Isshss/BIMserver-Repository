BIMserver-Repository
====================

Public repository for BIMserver services, plugins, extended data schema's and more

With this repository, we hope to make it easier for people to discover and publicize certain BIMserver related artifacts.

# Services

Services are pieces of logic, usually triggered by changes on a BIMserver.

# Extended Data Schemas

An Extended Data Schema is not a lot more than a globally unique namespace. It should help to identify pieces of Extended Data stored on a BIMserver. An example of this is the (BCF)[http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases] schema. By storing the Extended Data with a link to the BCF Extended Data Schema, software will know how to interpret the data. You could compare this to file extensions.

# Plugin

To be implemented, but the idea is to make plugins available here as well.

# Model Checker

Model Checkers are special plugins that can validate a model. To be implemented as well
